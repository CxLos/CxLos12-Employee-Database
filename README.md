# CxLos12-Employee-Database

## Description

My motivation to build this project was to learn how to use SQL databases in conjunction with Nodejs. I build this project so that future employers have a quick and simple tool to update employee information and have everything stored in one organized database consisiting of multiple tables. This solves the problem of clutter and disorganization that companies may face when trying to keep track of all important employment details. In creating this project, I learned how to create databases and tables using proper SQL format, how to create a connector between the database and node, and then have all the information come together to be functionally executed in the command line.
